So you've actually done security well and are using an external Redis provider that only allows TLS to talk to it. You could simply configure each of your applications to use TLS from the application pod or you can use Istio to handle the TLS part. This lightning talk demonstrates how to use Istio to do TLS origination for Redis (TCP) using the sidecar instead of the egress gateway.
