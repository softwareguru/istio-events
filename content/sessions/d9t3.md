Wouldn't it be great to have an easy way to dynamically, via istio, limit the traffic to a service in Kubernetes?

Figure out you have one or more ingress gateways for the incoming requests, and you want to limit the requests from a single IP, or to limit requests with an specific http header in an specific amount of time. 

With this operator you just have to create and deploy a simple Custom Resource (CR)  with your desired rate limit configuration. 

The operator, from this CR, will create the necessary istio objects to use the http level rate limit filter.
