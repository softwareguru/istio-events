At Mercari, we have few hundreds of services running in Kubernetes. We spent the last year and a half trying to integrate Istio in our microservices infrastructure at scale, with many trial-and-error and lessons learned.
This presentation will explain what is making Istio a long wild river and how we managed to navigate it.
It will focus on several aspects:
- Stabilizing Istio
- Adopting Istio
- Running Istio
By sharing our learnings, we hope to make Istio a long quiet river for the community.
